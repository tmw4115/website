Personal Blogsite creation.

The idea is to allow users to host their own public blogs that showcases current projects or thoughts.

I had thought of this idea when I heard someone mention that "to understand a topic, you must be able to teach it to a preschooler." Emphasizing that the need to document and teach others about the skills you are gaining or the projects you are working on is essential
to learning the very same topic you are writing about.
